After signing up, the user is directed to his home page. Here the user is able to create host servers. Each host server displays the % of ram and disk space being used by its virtual servers. On clicking one of the host servers, the user is directed to the host home page where all information regarding the host: its ram and disk size, and all the virtual servers it is hosting.

On the host home page, the user can add new virtual servers to the host. The user can also edit all the host parameters. This includes increasing and decreasing ram and disk capacity. After creating virtual servers, the user can also edit the individual virtual server parameters.

If the host is using any of its resources to the maximum, it won't be allowed to add new virtual servers unless the user increases this resource.

All ram and disk size parameters are restricted to positive integers and are measured in GBs.
